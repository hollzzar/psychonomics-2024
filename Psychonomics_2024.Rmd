# Background

```{r intro, out.width = "100%", out.extra = "", dpi = 300}
knitr::include_graphics("poster/intro_2_v2.svg")
```

- Talker-specific adaptation: Participants who train on Talker A during exposure tend to perform better on Talker A during test than participants who train on Talker B
- Adaptation to L2-accented talkers in **behavior**: Higher transcription accuracy during sentence comprehension (e.g., Clarke & Garrett, 2004) and faster reaction times during cross-modal priming (e.g., Xie et al., 2017)
- Adaptation to L2-accented talkers in **ERPs** has not been targeted systematically; rather, studies have compared mean ERPs between experiment halves (Gosselin et al., 2021; Hanulíková et al., 2012; Romero-Rivas et al., 2015)

# Methods

<div class = "my-div">Grand mean ERPs by prime type</div>

```{r grand_erp, out.width = "100%", out.extra = "", dpi = 300}

# Key take-aways

- Differential sensitivity to prime type emerged on the N1 as differences in priming decreased on the N400
- N1 modulation may reflect a shift in selective attention toward acoustic information (Joos et al., 2014)
- N400 modulation may reflect a concomitant shift away from lexical information
- Accent adaptation may involve a shift from top-down to bottom-up word recognition mechanisms

```

# Additional methods

- Participants: 41 Penn State undergrads, grad students, and community members
  - Mean age of 20 (18-35)
  - One excluded from ERP analyses (head injury)
  - All grew up speaking English at home
    - Four identified as bilingual (self-rated proficiency less than 3/5)
    - Four grew up in multilingual households 
    - Three indicated a dialect background other than American English (British, Canadian, Caribbean)
- Talker: Spanish-English bilingual from Mexico City, Mexico; age 31 at time of recording; moved to US at age 28; began acquiring English in school (age 5)
